		Football (or soccer as the game is called in some parts of the world)
		has a long history. Football in its current form arose in England in 
		the middle of the 19th century. But alternative versions of the game
		existed much earlier and are a part of the football history.
		
		Early history and the precursors of football:
		The first known examples of a team game involving a ball, which was made out of a rock,
		occurred in old Mesoamerican cultures for over 3,000 years ago. According to the sources,
		the ball would symbolize the sun and the captain of the losing team would be sacrificed 
		to the gods.
		
		The first known ball game which also involved kicking took place In China in the 3rd and 
		2nd century BC under the name Cuju. Cuju was played with a round ball on an area of a square.
		It later spread to Japan and was practiced under ceremonial forms.
		
		Other earlier variety of ball games had been known from Ancient Greece. The ball was
		made by shreds of leather filled with hair (the first documents of balls filled with
		air are from the 7th century). In the Ancient Rome, games with balls were not included
		in the entertainment on the big arenas, but could occur in exercises in the military.
		It was the Roman culture that would bring football to the British island (Britannica).
		It is, however, uncertain in which degree the British people were influenced by this
		variety and in which degree they had developed their own variants.`,

		baseball season. He affixed peach baskets overhead on the walls at opposite ends of 
		the gymnasium and organized teams to play his new game in which the purpose was to toss 
		an association (soccer) ball into one basket and prevent the opponents from tossing the ball
		into the other basket. Because Dr. Naismith had eighteen available players when he invented
		the game, the first rule was: “There shall be nine players on each side.” Later the number of
		players became optional, depending upon the size of the available court, but the five-player
		standard was adopted when the game spread over the country. U.S. soldiers brought basketball

		description: `It was in 12th century France that the ‘Courretiers de change’
		took on the task of managing and regulating agricultural communities debt.
		This was on behalf of the french banks of that time. This group of men traded
		the debts and became known as first brokers. In the thirteenth century a common
		misconception arose in Bruges. Commodity traders started to meet in a house that
		was owned by a gentleman named Van der Beurze, and so later, in 1409l, this 
		group became known as ‘Brugse Beurse’. This was the formalised, and even 
		institutionalised a meeting that had previously been known as an informal
		gathering. In actual fact, those meetings took place in a building in the 
		city of Antwerp that was owned by Van der Beurze. Most merchants of that
		time undertook their trading in the city of Antwerp. This idea spread across
		the region of Flanders very quickly, and also in neighbouring countries,
		and soon in the cites of Ghent and Rotterdam ‘Beurzen’ soon opened.

		It was in the middle of the thirteenth century in Venice, that bankers started
		to trade in government securities. It was soon outlawed in 1351, by the government 
		of Venice spreading stories. The idea behind this was to decreased the cost of
		Venetian government funds. In the large cities of Italy, including Pisa, Genoa,
		Florence and Verona, bankers started to trade, again with government securities.
		This happened around the fourteenth century. What allowed this trading to happen
		was that these cities were not ruled by a duke, but they were independent states
		in their own right. These states were ruled by an elected citizen council. Businesses
		and organisations in Italy were also the the first to sell shares on the stock market.
		It was not until the sixteenth century that businesses in the United Kingdom were able
		to sell shares. Many other countries then followed.
		
		The first joint-stock company was the Dutch East India country that was formed in 1602.
		A joint-stock company is an organisation in which stakes can be purchased and sold by
		shareholders. A shareholder may own a proportion of the business depending on how
		many shares they purchase. A certificate of ownership is issued to the shareholder
		detailing the proportion of shares held in the company. The Dutch East India company
		was the first to get fixed capital stock, and so company stock was continuously traded
		on Amsterdam Stock Exchange. It was not long after this happened that other trade
		followed, in different derivatives, came into being on the Amsterdam market.
		Something known as short selling also occurred. This is where securities
		that are not currently owned by anyone are attempted to be sold. This,
		however, was soon seen as illegal and was banned in 1610 by the authorities.
		
		Today, there are stock markets all over the world, in both those countries
		that are both developed, and developing. The most well known stock markets,
		and the worlds largest are in the United States of America, as well as in
		the United Kingdom, China, Canada, India, Japan, Germany, France, Netherlands 
		and South Korea.`,

		title: "Israel's War of Independence",
		description: `In December 1946 - at the first post-war Zionist Congress in Basle
		- David Ben Gurion assumed the defense portfolio, including responsibility for
		the Haganah, which at the time concentrated on the struggle against the British.

		Although British restrictions, searches and detentions made the building of
		a clandestine force - with armor and artillery, air and sea power - well-nigh
		impossible, Ben-Gurion decided early on that this was the decisive task:
		to build up a force in preparation for an assault by the regular armies
		of the Arab countries, which the yishuv would have to face alone, without outside help.
		
		He found the Haganah woefully ill prepared for such an eventuality and set
		about energetically to rectify this. Since import and deployment of heavy
		weapons were not practicable as long as the British held sway over Palestine,
		it was decided that manpower should be readied in the country and equipment
		purchased abroad - to be "married" in time to throw back an Arab assault, 
		if not to prevent it; in time for 15 May 1948, the day envisaged for the 
		termination of the British Mandate and the day after Israel would declare its independence.
		
		The War of Independence (1947-49)
		
		The war was fought along the entire, long border of the country: against
		Lebanon and Syria in the north; Iraq and Transjordan - renamed Jordan
		during the war - in the east; Egypt, assisted by contingents from the 
		Sudan - in the south; and Palestinians and volunteers from Arab countries 
		in the interior of the country.
		
		It was the bloodiest of Israel's wars. It cost 6,373 killed in action
		 		from pre-state days until 20 July 1949) almost 1% of the yishuv (the Jewish community) - although that 
		figure includes quite a number of new immigrants and some foreign volunteers.
		
		In the First Phase (29 November 1947 - 1 April 1948), it was the Palestinian
		Arabs who took the offensive, with the help of volunteers from neighboring countries;
		the yishuv had little success in limiting the war - it suffered severe casualties and
		disruption of passage along most of the major highways.
		
		In the Second Phase (1 April - 15 May) the Haganah took the initiative, and in six weeks
		was able to turn the tables - capturing, inter alia, the Arab sections of Tiberias, Haifa
		and later also Safed and Acre, temporarily opening the road to Jerusalem and gaining control
		of much of the territory alotted to the Jewish State under the UN Resolution.
		
		The Third Phase (15 May - 19 July), considered the critical one, opened with the simultaneous,
		coordinated assault on the fledgling state by five regular Arab armies from neighboring countries,
		with an overwhelming superiority of heavy equipment - armor, artillery and airforce.
		On 31 May the Haganah was renamed the "Israel Defence Forces". The IDF suffered initial setbacks,
		including the loss of the Etzion Bloc in Judea, the area of Mishmar Hayarden in the north and Yad
		Mordehai in the south, but after three weeks was able to halt the offensive, to stabilize the front
		and even initiate some local offensive operations.
		
		The Fourth Phase (19 July 1948 - 20 July, 1949) was characterized by Israeli initiatives: Operation
		Yoav, in October, cleared the road to the Negev, culminating in the capture of Be'er Sheva; Operation
		Hiram, at the end of October, resulted in the capture of the Upper Galilee; Operation Horev in December
		1948 and Operation Uvda in March 1949, completed the capture of the Negev,
		which had been alotted to the Jewish State by the United Nations.
		
		Simultaneously, the Arab countries signed Armistice Agreements: first came Egypt - 24 February 1949;
		followed by Lebanon - 23 March; Jordan - 3 April; and Syria - 20 July. Only Iraq did not sign an armistice
		agreement with Israel. It preferred to withdraw its troops and hand over its sector to the Arab Legion of Jordan.
		
		In the end Israel not only ejected the invading Arab forces - it also captured and held some 5,000 km2 
		over and above the areas allocated to it by the United Nations.
		
		In the middle of the War of Independence, the IDF was born, not on 15 May, but two weeks later; for two 
		more weeks Ben-Gurion negotiated with the "dissident" armed organizations, the Etzel and Lehi, convincing
		them to disband voluntarily before he disbanded them in the Order of the Establishment of the IDF on 31 May 1948.
		That order provided for only one armed force, subordinate to the constitutional government. There was complete
		continuity between the Haganah and the IDF: Ya'acov Dori, the Chief of Staff; the members of the General Staff;
		the commanders from brigade-level downwards - all were automatically confirmed in their appointments.
		
		At the end of the war the IDF had over 100,000 full-time men and women in uniform, as compared to the mere handful
		of full-time soldiers at its beginning. In addition to 12 brigades, mostly infantry, it had several regiments of
		artillery. The first armored regiments were equipped with light armored vehicles, some captured, some "requisitioned"
		from the departing British troops; and a few tanks - two Cromwells "bought" from the withdrawing British and some
		reconstituted from American scrap.
		The Navy consisted at first of reconverted illegal immigrant vessels. There were the elements of an Air Force - Spitfires
		and Messerschmidts, acquired mainly in Czechoslovakia, in addition to the light civilian planes which the Haganah had
		used for reconnaissance and communications purposes. Some World War II US war surplus bombers were bought as scrap. These
		carried out their first "strategic attack" on Cairo, en route to Israel, even before reaching their homebase. Armed with
		a Baedeker tourist guide, one of them bombed and strafed Abdeen Palace: rudimentary, to be sure, but entirely unexpected
		and, therefore, psychologically effective.
		
		As soon as the armistice agreements were signed and the immediate danger had passed, the IDF - except for a small nucleus - was not only
		demobilized, but effectively disbanded. The new state had urgent tasks which required all its resources, above all that of absorbing the
		flood of new immigrants, who at last were able to come "home". An attempt to keep the demobilized soldiers in some sort of reserve framework
		failed. However, for the time being there was little inclination on the Arab side to renew full-scale fighting. Not that they had come to
		face reality and recognized Israel - far from it; but they did realize that to fight against Israel required thorough preparation.
		
		In the meantime they found what was considered a perfect tool to show their own people that the war was not over yet and at the same time
		both to harrass Israel and embarrass her. Palestinian fedayun (suicide troops) infiltrated across the long and ill-protected border - and
		it should be recalled that no place in Israel was far from the border: infiltrations for the purpose of stealing farm equipment were 
		followed by the laying of mines, the killing of individuals, and wholesale massacres. The fedayun were trained, equipped and paid for 
		by Egyptian Intelligence, although they operated mainly from bases in Jordan, so that Jordan would bear the brunt of Israel's retaliation,
		which inevitably followed. And each time Israel retaliated, the Security Council condemned it; condemnation of an Arab government had long
		since become an impossibility, because of the Soviet veto.`,
